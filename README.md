# ccguilt

**Claude Code Guilt Trip** — a satirical environmental impact tracker for your AI habit.

Reads your local Claude Code session data and computes token usage, API cost, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, water usage, and tree destruction metrics. All wrapped in darkly humorous commentary backed by peer-reviewed research.

## Install

```bash

## Shell Completions

Enable tab completion for all flags and options:

```bash
ccguilt --setup-completions          # auto-detect your shell
ccguilt --setup-completions bash     # explicit shell
ccguilt --setup-completions zsh

ccguilt --increase-guilt             # check for updates and self-update
ccguilt --mcp                        # run as an MCP server (see below)
ccguilt --setup-mcp                  # one-shot register MCP server with Claude Code
ccguilt --version                    # print version
```

## MCP Server

ccguilt can run as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so Claude Code can call it during your conversations to check usage in real time.

If you installed via `install.sh` and have Claude Code on your PATH, it's already registered — skip ahead to the tools list. Otherwise:

```bash
ccguilt --setup-mcp        # one-shot, idempotent, registers at user scope
```

(If you'd rather do it manually: `claude mcp add --scope user ccguilt -- $(which ccguilt) --mcp`.)

Then in any Claude Code session, ask things like *"how much CO2 have I burned today?"* and Claude will call the ccguilt tools directly.

### Tools exposed

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ccguilt_today` | Today's tokens, cost, energy, CO2, water, trees, guilt level |
| `ccguilt_total` | All-time cumulative impact |
| `ccguilt_range` | Custom date range — `since`/`until` accept YYYY-MM-DD, `7d`, `last-week`, `yesterday`, `monday`, etc. |

### Tree-fallen warnings

Each tool response may include a `tree_fallen_warning` field with a satirical message — but only when a *new* tree's worth of CO2 (22 kg) has accumulated since the last warning. State is persisted in `~/.local/share/ccguilt/mcp_state.json`, so you'll see one warning per tree, naturally rate-limited. On first install the current floor is recorded silently — historical accumulation doesn't trigger a flood of warnings.

## What it shows

| Column | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Tokens | Input, output, cache read/write tokens | Claude Code JSONL session files |
| Cost | Estimated API cost in USD | Anthropic pricing (per model tier) |
| Energy | Watt-hours consumed | Jegham et al. 2025, Luccioni et al. 2023 |
| CO2 | Carbon dioxide emitted | EPA eGRID 2024 (0.39 kg/kWh US avg) |
| Water | Data center cooling water | Li et al. 2023 "Making AI Less Thirsty" |
| Trees | Equivalent trees destroyed per year | EPA (22 kg CO2/tree/year absorption) |
| Guilt | 7-tier satirical rating | Your conscience |

## Guilt Ratings

| Rating | CO2 Threshold | Flavor |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Digital Saint | < 10g | "Your carbon footprint is basically a carbon toe-print" |
| Carbon Curious | < 100g | "Dipping your toes into environmental destruction" |
| Tree Trimmer | < 500g | "A few branches fell. The forest will recover. Probably." |
| Forest Flattener | < 2kg | "The squirrels are filing a class action" |
| Eco-Terrorist | < 10kg | "Greenpeace has entered the chat. And they brought lawyers." |
| Planet Incinerator | < 50kg | "Making Venus look hospitable" |
| Heat Death Accelerator | 50kg+ | "The universe was going to end eventually. You're just helping it along." |

## Environmental Data Sources

All environmental calculations are backed by peer-reviewed research:

- **Energy per token**: Jegham et al. 2025 "How Hungry is AI?", Luccioni et al. 2023 "Power Hungry Processing"
- **Carbon intensity**: EPA eGRID 2024 (US average grid: 0.39 kgCO2/kWh)
- **Water usage**: Li et al. 2023 "Making AI Less Thirsty" (WUE: 1.8 L/kWh)
- **Tree absorption**: EPA (22 kg CO2/tree/year), USDA Forestry (3,900 L water/tree/year)
- **Data center PUE**: Industry average 1.2x overhead

## How it reads your data

ccguilt reads Claude Code's local session files at `~/.claude/projects/`. It parses JSONL conversation logs to extract per-message token usage with model identification, then aggregates by your chosen time period.

- **Deep scan** (default): Parses all JSONL session files with parallel processing (rayon). Accurate per-model energy calculation.
- **Fast mode** (`--fast`): Reads `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` for instant results with estimated token distribution.
